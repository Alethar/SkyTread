# SkyTreader-Arduino

Code for the Arduino Mega 2560 on board my RC plane

Transmitter has 6 channels
CH 3 - Throttle, left stick Y
CH 4 - Roll, left stick X
CH 2 - Pitch, right stick Y
CH 1 - Yaw, right stick X
// Note: may switch Roll and Yaw channels

Purpose: 
-Link throttle to both ESCs (right EDF and left EDF)

-Set up differential thrust

-Set up servo bindings

-Later, set up gyroscope and PID balancing code

-Integration of Ardupilot? Auto flight and GPS/mapping? Camera gimbal? future plans
